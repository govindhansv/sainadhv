Create a program for a Student Database using a Python dictionary.
Your program should be able to:
1. Add student details (roll number as key, name as value).

2. Update student details (change name using roll number).

3. Remove a student from the database.

4. View all students (display roll numbers and names).

5. Search for a student using roll number.

6. Show total number of students in the database.

7. Exit the program when the user wants.

ðŸ‘‰ Use dictionary operations like:
dict[key] = value (add/update)
pop() (remove)
items() (view all)
in (search)
len() (count)
